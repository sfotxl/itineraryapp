# A basic React App website for a summer vacation!

This is a project created while taking the React course of the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp at Nucamp in Spring 2022. 
The website is hosted by Netlify [here](https://hamburg.netlify.app/).

## Views

### City View
After clicking a city from the landing page, a chronological itinerary for that city is built from an array of all events planned for the trip. Each event links to relevant information. The grid is responsive. 

### By Day
A dropdown menu in the navbar lets you choose a day from which to create an itinerary in events grid. 

### Home View
Clicking home in the navbar displays a random grid of event cards - images of the event and the city wherein the event will take place, for a visual view designed to get one excited about the trip! Clicking a card brings users to the appropriate city view of the itinerary.
